turnkey-dokuwiki-18.0 (1) turnkey; urgency=low

  * Install latest upstream version of DokuWiki 4: Release 2023-04-04a "Jack
    Jackrum"

  * Special thanks to Daniele Lolli aka UncleDan <github@uncledan.it> for
    work on this (and many other) v18.0 app updates.

  * Debian default PHP updated to v8.2.

  * Upgraded base distribution to Debian 12.x/Bookworm.

  * Configuration console (confconsole):
    - Support for DNS-01 Let's Encrypt challenges.
      [ Oleh Dmytrychenko <dmytrychenko.oleh@gmail.com> github: @NitrogenUA ]
    - Support for getting Let's Encrypt cert via IPv6 - closes #1785.
    - Refactor network interface code to ensure that it works as expected and
      supports more possible network config (e.g. hotplug interfaces & wifi).
    - Show error message rather than stacktrace when window resized to
      incompatable resolution - closes  #1609.
      [ Stefan Davis <stefan@turnkeylinux.org> ]
    - Bugfix exception when quitting configuration of mail relay.
      [ Oleh Dmytrychenko <dmytrychenko.oleh@gmail.com> github: @NitrogenUA ]
    - Improve code quality: implement typing, fstrings and make (mostly) PEP8
      compliant.
      [Stefan Davis <stefan@turnkeylinux.org> & Jeremy Davis

  * Firstboot Initialization (inithooks):
    - Refactor start up (now hooks into getty process, rather than having it's
      own service).
      [ Stefan Davis <stefan@turnkeylinux.org> ]
    - Refactor firstboot.d/01ipconfig (and 09hostname) to ensure that hostname
      is included in dhcp info when set via inithooks.
    - Package turnkey-make-ssl-cert script (from common overlay - now packaged
      as turnkey-ssl). Refactor relevant scripts to leverage turnkey-ssl.
    - Refactor run script - use bashisms and general tidying.
    - Show blacklisted password characters more nicely.
    - Misc packaging changes/improvements.
    - Support returning output from MySQL - i.e. support 'SELECT'. (Only
      applies to apps that include MySQL/MariaDB).

  * Web management console (webmin):
    - Upgraded webmin to v2.0.21.
    - Removed stunnel reverse proxy (Webmin hosted directly now).
    - Ensure that Webmin uses HTTPS with default cert
      (/etc/ssl/private/cert.pem).
    - Disabled Webmin Let's Encrypt (for now).

  * Web shell (shellinabox):
    - Completely removed in v18.0 (Webmin now has a proper interactive shell).

  * Backup (tklbam):
    - Ported dependencies to Debian Bookworm; otherwise unchanged.

  * Security hardening & improvements:
    - Generate and use new TurnKey Bookworm keys.
    - Automate (and require) default pinning for packages from Debian
      backports. Also support non-free backports.

  * IPv6 support:
    - Adminer (only on LAMP based apps) listen on IPv6.
    - Nginx/NodeJS (NodeJS based apps only) listen on IPv6.

  * Misc bugfixes & feature implementations:
    - Remove rsyslog package (systemd journal now all that's needed).
    - Include zstd compression support.
    - Enable new non-free-firmware apt repo by default.
    - Improve turnkey-artisan so that it works reliably in cron jobs (only
      Laravel based LAMP apps).
